## LDTS_14_08 - Space Invaders

In this 2D fixed shooter game, the player controls a spaceship that shoots lasers!
The objective of the player is to fire at the aliens and survive. The game will have a couple of levels (that go up in difficulty) and a final boss!

This project was made and developed by Pedro Borges (up202207552@fe.up.pt), Alexandre Lopes (up202207015@fe.up.pt) and Tom√°s Linhares (up202207236@fe.up.pt) for LP01 2023/2024.

## IMPLEMENTED FEATURES 

There still are no implemented features.

## PLANNED FEATURES 

Trivial things like the movement of the player and of the aliens (and the drawing of both), spawn of power-ups after a certain amount of kills, score showing on the screen, lifes showing on the screen, collisions, menu,
levels, final boss.
(We need GUI Mock-Ups to show this planned features)

## DESIGN

#### THE SHOOT ACTION SHOULD BE DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHICH/NONE POWER-UP

There was a lot of usage of conditional logic when deciding how would the spaceship behave while shooting, since shooting should be different based on which power-up (triple-shot, faster speed shooting, shield...). 

We (not yet) applied the State pattern. Making it possible to distinguish different states based on what power-ups the player has...
